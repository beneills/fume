* TODO / Ideas
- rating / notes on timeboxes?
- better output format so we don't have to call `clear` all the time
- needs to be faster, mostly because YAML parsing is slow
- daemon mode for status line?
- send "0" days for "total" Beeminder goals
- get Beeminder's data and do a sanity check
- sanity checks, probably by turning entry hash-kludges into proper Entry class (again)
