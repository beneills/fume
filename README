Idea
====

Quoting myself: 
> Assuming you have a good idea what tasks you want to do in total, just
> automate it. Try to delegate away as many day-to-day decisions as you can.

> I extended my todo scripts for that exact purpose. I track how much time I
> spend on each task and how much time I should spend, based on a relative
> weight. (As in, this task is 2x as important as this and so on. I estimate my
> weights by starting with 200 usable hours per month and then distribute them
> among all tasks, using the assigned hours as a weight.) The script then checks
> if "time spent on task this week" is close to the relative time it should
> receive, according to the total time I've worked so far, and sorts all tasks
> based on their deficit. I then just do whatever project is furthest behind for
> as long as I can concentrate, let the script pick the next one and so on.

> Advantages: I never have to make any decision except when choosing the initial
> projects. (This happens rarely and is no problem.) No individual project ever
> gets ignored. I don't have to bother with timeboxes, I just work for at least
> ~15 minutes (I have an automated alarm for that) and then continue until I get
> bored / tired. I only have to personally check and maximize one variable -
> total time worked per day. It's as simple as "make this number go up".
